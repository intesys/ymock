# Contribution guidelines

## Did you find a bug?

Search if a related issue already exists. If it doesn't exist, you can open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Do you intend to write a patch to fix a bug?

The first thing to do is to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them. Then, you must open a working branch and do the changes. When everything is done, open a pull request (PR) targeting the original repository and add a description that covers all the changes that are being submitted. Don't forget to [link the PR with its corresponding issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue), if it has one. Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainers edits](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

You can find new features to be developed in the [ROADMAP](./ROADMAP.md) list. For writing the code and submitting it, you should follow the same procedures described in the previous section (fork the repo, open a PR, etc.).
